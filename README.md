# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project implements **Fake News Detection** using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification to distinguish between fake and real news articles.

## Features
âœ… **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Removing noise, tokenization, and text normalization.
âœ… **Feature Extraction** â€“ Using **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF**.
âœ… **Machine Learning Models** â€“ Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
âœ… **Deep Learning Models** â€“ CNN, RNN.
âœ… **Evaluation & Visualization** â€“ Performance metrics and data visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn)
- **Deep Learning** (TensorFlow/Keras)
- **NLP** (NLTK, TF-IDF, BoW)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake-News-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fake-News-Detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Fake News Detection.ipynb"
   ```

## Usage
- Load the dataset and preprocess the text.
- Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning models (CNN, RNN).
- Evaluate model performance and visualize results.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in detecting fake news.
- CNN and RNN models improved classification performance compared to traditional ML models.
